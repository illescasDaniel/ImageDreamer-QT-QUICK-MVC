# ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC
Simple app to generate images from text. Currently, it uses DreamShaperXL v2 (SDXL Turbo).

</p>

## Requirements
- "DreamShaperXL v2 model", it will be automatically downloaded.
- invoke (Optional, but recommended to easily build and run the app)
- HuggingFace's accelerate, diffusers and transformers
- Pytorch
- PySide6
- GPU required. It works with NVIDIA GPUs (tested on 8GB 4070 Laptop) and Apple Silicon chips (untested).

## Development requirements
- pytest (unit tests)
- pyinstaller (create executable in tasks.py)
- pipreqs (genereate requirements.txt in tasks.py)

**TIP:** use `install-dev.sh` to install these necessary dependencies to work on this project on a conda virtual environment named "ImageDreamer-dev".

## Easy installation using conda (Anaconda/miniconda) [Recommended]
1. Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/illescasDaniel/ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC.git`
`cd ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC`.
2. Install conda (anaconda or miniconda).
https://www.anaconda.com/download
https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/
3. Create a conda environment with all its dependencies.
	- Ubuntu/macOS: `./install.sh`
	- Windows (**Anaconda Powershell Prompt**, outside of VSCode): `.\install.ps1`
4. Activate the new environment: `conda activate ImageDreamer`
5. Run the app: `invoke run`
6. Images will be saved to the output folder automatically.

**Note:** this is the preferred way.

**NOTE:** The first time you run it, after you press the "Generate" button it will download the model/s, please be patient, you can see the progress in the terminal where you run the command.

## Easy installation using pip
- **Notes**:
	- I couldn't get this method to work on my Windows machine.
1. Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/illescasDaniel/ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC.git`
`cd ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv imagedreamer-env`
3. Activate the new environment: `source imagedreamer-env/bin/activate` (`deactivate` to deactivate it)
4. Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the app with `python3 src/main.py` or `invoke run` or `inv run`.

## Easy and fast installation using uv: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
0. `pip install uv` (if not installed already in your system)
1. Clone the repo. `git clone https://github.com/illescasDaniel/ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC.git`
`cd ImageDreamer-QT-QUICK-MVC`
2. Create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
3. Activate the new environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (`deactivate` to deactivate it)
4. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the app with `python3 src/main.py` or `invoke run` or `inv run`.

**Note**: <sup>"Having Qt installed in your system will not interfere with your PySide6 installation if you do it via pip install, because the Python packages (wheels) include already Qt binaries. Most notably, style plugins from the system wonâ€™t have any effect on PySide applications." source: https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/quickstart.html </sup> This means you won't use your system's default style if you use pip to install pyside6, AFAIK.


## Execution
Use `invoke run` to run the python app.

You can use `invoke --list` for all available tasks, use `invoke --help <command>` to get help about a specific command.

### TODOs:
- [ ] Test app on different devices. **[WIP]**
	- [x] Test on linux
	- [x] Test on windows
	- [ ] Test on macOS
- [ ] Add unit tests with `pytest`.
	- [ ] Update tasks.py with tests
- [ ] Test pyinstaller. **[WIP]**
	- [x] Test pyinstaller on linux
	- [x] Test pyinstaller on windows
	- [ ] Test pyinstaller on macOS
	- [ ] Add `Instructions.txt` file in `dist/ImageDreamer`?
- [ ] Maybe refactor main.qml
