# Development Requirements

For development, you will need additional tools to run tests, create executables, and manage dependencies.

- `invoke` for running tasks defined in `tasks.py`
- `pyinstaller` for creating executables in `tasks.py`
- `pipreqs` for generating `requirements.txt` in `tasks.py`
- `pytest` for unit tests

## Setup

Use `install-dev.sh` to install these dependencies in a Conda virtual environment named "ImageDreamer-dev".
