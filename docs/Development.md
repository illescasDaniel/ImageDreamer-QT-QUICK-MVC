# Development Requirements

For development, you will need additional tools to run tests, create executables, and manage dependencies.

- `invoke` for running tasks defined in `/tasks`
- `pyinstaller` for creating executables.
- `pipreqs` for generating `requirements.txt`.
- `pytest` for running unit tests.

## Setup

Run `./install.py --dev` to install all the necessary dependencies in a Conda virtual environment named "ImageDreamer-dev".
